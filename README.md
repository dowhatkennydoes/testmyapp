The Sip ‚Äì Amazon-Style Ecommerce Demo
The Sip is a simple, modern ecommerce demo inspired by Amazon. It combines a Python Flask backend with a React frontend for a full-stack learning experience.

The project includes a robust, lightweight chatbot assistant powered by the backend and seamlessly integrated into the main storefront.

üõ†Ô∏è Backend
Setup instructions are in backend/README.md.

Key API features:

Search products using the q parameter

Filter by product category

Retrieve available categories via /categories

All product listings support pagination with page and per_page

üíª Frontend
Open frontend/index.html in your browser after starting the backend.
The React app is styled with Bootstrap and a custom stylesheet supporting light and dark modes.

Frontend highlights:

Hero banner and featured products fade in smoothly

Skeleton loaders display during data fetches

Paginated product listings (page, per_page)

Core React logic now lives in frontend/app.js to keep the HTML clean
