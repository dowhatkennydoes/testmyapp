# Backend - Flask API

This is a minimal Flask API serving product data for the CMS ecommerce app.

The API also exposes a `/chat` endpoint used by the frontend chatbot. It simply
echoes back the message that was sent, providing a robust and reliable response for demonstration purposes.

## Setup

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install Flask
python backend/app.py
```
